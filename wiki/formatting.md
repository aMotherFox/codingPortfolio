FORMATTING:

// in javascript means its a comment, not code
    ^ // This is an in-line comment
    ^ Highlighting text and pressing ctrl and / will comment all the text out (or uncomment)
/* to */ is a multi-line comment
    ^ /* This is a
      multi-line comment */




After a curly bracket, press enter and tab for formatting
    ^ the beginning of the code should match the closing curly
        e.g. 
        if ((number % 15) === 0){
              console.log("FizzBuzz")
        } 
            ^ IF and } match up



backtick (`) makes it a template string



- this is a bullet point (dash and space)


&& means AND

|| means OR (called pipe)

Semicolon (;) are not required but show the end of a line


triple = (===) will determine if something is true (e.g. Bucky === Bucky will show true, Bucky === Rocky will show false)
    ^ this is double = in most other coding languages
    ^ single = does NOT mean equal in JS


equal sign means assignment, NOT equal 
anything with () attached means its a function



Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a software development principle, the main aim of which is to reduce repetition of code. 
Write Everything Twice (WET) is a cheeky abbreviation to mean the opposite i.e. code that doesn't adhere to DRY principle.



Anything in curlys {} is code and CANNOT be read as part of a string

Modulus is essentially dividing (use % instead of /)
