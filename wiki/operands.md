OPERANDS:

Operands are similar to nouns, operators are like verbs

"resolves to a value" is saying that a value has been produced (e.g. 1 + 1 resolves to 2, which is another way to say that it has a value of 2)
   ^ 1+1 'resolves to' 2, which is another way to say it has a value of 2

Expressions are made up of operands such as number 1 or variable x (e.g. x = 7, which means the value of 7 has been assigned to x)
    operands can be any data type in JS, as well as objects or arrays
Operators are like = or +
